# ALDA
Algorithms and Datastructures

Alda Queue
A simple queue with the basic functions that a queue is supposed to have.

Alda Tree
A basic binary tree. All methods are done recursively

Alda hashing
DoublehashProbing, quadraticProbing, LinearProbing, A well thought out hashcode for a book.


Alda DHeap
A dHeap with both percolate up and down implemented, has been tested for d value 3.

Alda graph
An undirected weighted graph. Both breadth and depth first search implemented. Finding a minimumspanning tree method is implemented
with the help of dijkstras algorithm.
