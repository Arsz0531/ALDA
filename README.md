# ALDA
Algorithms and Datastructures
The repository contains code from various weekly tasks in the ALDA course at DSV in Stockholm, the code is written between 
21 Jan - 18 March 2019.


Alda Queue
A simple queue with the basic functions that a queue is supposed to have.

Alda Tree
A basic binary tree. All methods are done recursively

Alda hashing
DoublehashProbing, quadraticProbing, LinearProbing, A well thought out hashcode for a book.


Alda DHeap
A dHeap with both percolate up and down implemented, has been tested for d value 3.

Alda graph
An undirected weighted graph. Both breadth and depth first search implemented. Finding a minimumspanning tree method is implemented
with the help of dijkstras algorithm.

Alda huffmanCompressor
Compressor and decompressor using the huffman technique. Note that this does not really compress anything but it works in "theory".
Two different implementations of decompression, one is with the help of the actual huffman tree and the other one is with the help of
a hashmap.
